    `Take the Center If youâ€™re the first player (X), always start by taking the center square. This gives you the most opportunities to create a line of three.`,
    `Control the Corners If the center is taken, aim for a corner. Corners are strategic because they can be part of multiple winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).`,
    `Block Your Opponent Always keep an eye on your opponentâ€™s moves. If they have two in a row, block them immediately to prevent them from winning.`,
    `Create a Fork Try to set up a situation where you have two ways to win on your next move. This forces your opponent to block one, allowing you to win with the other.`,
    `Avoid Traps If your opponent takes the center, be careful not to let them create a fork. Focus on blocking their potential winning moves.`,
    `Force a Draw If both players play optimally, Tic Tac Toe will always end in a draw. Focus on blocking your opponent and creating opportunities without leaving openings.`,
    `Practice Patterns Learn common patterns and strategies. The more you play, the better youâ€™ll recognize winning opportunities and traps.`,
    `Play as Second Player (O) If youâ€™re the second player, your goal is usually to force a draw. Focus on blocking and mirroring your opponentâ€™s moves to prevent them from creating a fork.`,
